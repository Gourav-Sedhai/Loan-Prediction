About:
-----
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal amount borrowed.

So this project is based on prediction which of the customers will have their loan paid or not.

This python project of prediction of customers paying back loan or not deals with different informations of customers. Using seaborn, I plotted some informations related to the customers and since it is a supervised classification problem to be trained with algorithms like: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, I used the algorithms; Decision Tree and Random Forest. And in the end, the accuracy score, the confusion matrix and the classification report tells us how well our model showed the performance on prediction.
